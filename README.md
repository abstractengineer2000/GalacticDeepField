# GalacticDeepField
Create a Galactic Deep field in Space Engine
For non Programmers, Copy the *.sc files tp ..\SpaceEngine\addons\catalogs\galaxies and search for ABS,PQR and XYZ named galaxies and zoom, exposure, saturation to ur liking and post process in Gimp/Photoshop if required. Use reshade https://reshade.me/ for further effects.
For Programmers, modify the location to where u want the file to be generated. The RA,DEC,Dist,radius are required to specify a galaxy with the min max being the range of uniform distribution. The galaxy type is distributed according to a probability distribution function as elliptical =20% Spiral = 75% and Irregular = 5% and equally among the sub categories.
